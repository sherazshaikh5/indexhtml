                    Intro to HTML
                </h1>
            </u></b>
        <p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the basic language used in the creation of web pages. Hypertext refers
            to
            text stored in electronic format that can be cross-linked, and markup language refers to a set of
            instructions
            for displaying information. When HTML was initially developed in the early 1990s, web pages consisted
            primarily
            of text and the first version of HTML was primarily concerned with displaying text. However, HTML has
            evolved
            over the years and now HTML can instruct the browser not only how to display text information but such
            component
            parts of a web page as: graphics, multimedia, scripts, etc.

            In the early days of web design there were no standardized rules for HTML, and different browsers would
            display
            web pages differently. In addition, Netscape and Explorer, the two most popular web browsers at the time,
            started creating their own versions of HTML, meaning that a web page designed for Netscape might not display
            properly in Explorer, and visa versa. To resolve these problems, the World Wide Web Consortium was founded
            in
            1994. Its goal is to set standards that all those involved in web site creation could follow, and that would
            be
            displayed similarly no matter which browser was used. The World Wide Web Consortium was instrumental in
            creating
            and updating HTML versions, as web pages grew more sophisticated. HTML versions have changed with the times,
            starting with HTML 2.0 in 1995 (there was no HTML 1.0 designation even though HTML had been in use for
            several
            years before HTML 2.0) to the most current version in production: HTML 5.0

            Another key development that impacted HTML was the creation of XML, or Extensible Markup Language, which is
            basically a standard for the creation of Markup Languages, stricter than the standards followed by HTML. To
            create a version of HMTL to conform to XML standards, the World Wide Web Consortium developed XHTML, which
            is
            basically HTML with stricter guidelines.

            HTML is a series of text instructions that instruct a web browser how to display a web page, as mentioned
            above,
            and therefore a web page can theoretically be designed with a text editor, such as Notepad or Word. However,
            in
            practice it is common to use software designed specifically for web page creation, such as Dreamweaver. With
            this software it is possible in theory to design an advanced website without any familiarity with HTML.
